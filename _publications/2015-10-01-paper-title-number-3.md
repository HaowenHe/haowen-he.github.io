## Descriptions
* Constructed a detailed explanation of the solutions to the Classic Monty Hall Problem utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, decision trees, and mathematical concepts of conditional probability, mainly Bayes’ Theorem
* Investigated the various Monty Hall variants and the benefits of different winning strategies, and provided both the intuition and a mathematical justification for the solutions to Monty variations based on possible host behaviors and additional generalizations of the problem
* Discovered the psychological mechanisms for solving the Monty Hall Problem by designing experiments using cognitive manipulations, including perspective change, mental models, and the less-is-more effect
